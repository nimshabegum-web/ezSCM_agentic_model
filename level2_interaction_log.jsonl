Sunlight appears white to us, but it's actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet).\n\n2. **Refraction:** As sunlight enters a raindrop, it slows down and bends (refracts).  This is because light travels slower in water than in air.  Different colors of light bend at slightly different angles.  Violet light bends the most, and red light bends the least.\n\n3. **Reflection:** Once inside the raindrop, the light reflects off the back inner surface of the droplet.\n\n4. **Second Refraction:**  After reflecting, the light exits the raindrop.  It undergoes a second refraction as it passes from water back into air, further separating the colors.\n\n5. **Dispersion:** This process of separating the colors of light is called dispersion. The separation of colors, combined with the reflection, causes the light to spread out into a spectrum, forming the arc of a rainbow.\n\n6. **Observer's Perspective:** You see a rainbow because you're positioned at the correct angle to receive the dispersed light from many raindrops.  Each raindrop contributes a tiny bit of color to the overall rainbow effect.  That's why you can't ever actually reach the end of a rainbow \u2014 it's a perspective phenomenon."}
